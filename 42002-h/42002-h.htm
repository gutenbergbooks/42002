  <p>ILLUSTRATIONS AND ENQUIRIES RELATING TO MESMERISM. Part I. By the Rev.
  S. R. MAITLAND, D.D. F.R.S. F.S.A. Sometime Librarian to the late
  Archbishop of Canterbury, and Keeper of the MSS. at Lambeth.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"One of the most valuable and interesting pamphlets we ever
  read."&mdash;<i>Morning Herald.</i></p>

  <p>"This publication, which promises to be the commencement of a larger
  work, will well repay serious perusal."&mdash;<i>Ir. Eccl. Journ.</i></p>

  <p>"A small pamphlet in which he throws a startling light on the
  practices of modern Mesmerism."&mdash;<i>Nottingham Journal.</i></p>

  <p>"Dr. Maitland, we consider, has here brought Mesmerism to the
  'touchstone of truth,' to the test of the standard of right or wrong. We
  thank him for this first instalment of his inquiry, and hope that he will
  not long delay the remaining portions."&mdash;<i>London Medical
  Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>"The Enquiries are extremely curious, we should indeed say important.
  That relating to the Witch of Endor is one of the most successful we ever
  read. We cannot enter into particulars in this brief notice; but we would
  strongly recommend the pamphlet even to those who care nothing about
  Mesmerism, or <i>angry</i> (for it has come to this at last) with the
  subject."&mdash;<i>Dublin Evening Post.</i></p>

  <p>"We recommend its general perusal as being really an endeavour, by one
  whose position gives him the best facilities, to ascertain the genuine
  character of Mesmerism, which is so much disputed."&mdash;<i>Woolmer's
  Exeter Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>"Dr. Maitland has bestowed a vast deal of attention on the subject for
  many years past, and the present pamphlet is in part the result of his
  thoughts and inquiries. There is a good deal in it which we should have
  been glad to quote ... but we content ourselves with referring our
  readers to the pamphlet itself."&mdash;<i>Brit. Mag.</i></p>

<h3>PROPHETS: FRANCIS DOBBS.</h3>

  <p>Among the characters introduced to the readers of "N. &amp; Q.," under
  the name of <i>prophets</i>, there are few that deserve so distinguished
  a place as Mr. Francis Dobbs. Not only has he a claim to that title, in
  the derisive sense in which it is applied to all modern enthusiasts, but
  also on the higher grounds of political sagacity and practical wisdom.
  Some men have exhibited this double character successively, and at
  different periods of their lives; but none have displayed it in such
  happy union as Mr. Dobbs. Indeed, in that respect, he is perhaps one of
  the most striking instances on record of what is called the "duality of
  the human mind."</p>

  <p>The information I am able to furnish respecting this remarkable man,
  is derived from a pamphlet, published "by authority" (probably himself),
  by J. Jones, Dublin, 1800, and entitled, <i>Memoirs of Francis Dobbs,
  Esq.; also Genuine Reports of his Speeches in Parliament on the Subject
  of an Union, and his Prediction of the Second Coming of the Messiah, with
  Extracts from his Poem on the Millennium</i>.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dobbs was born on April 27, 1750; and was the younger son of the
  Rev. Richard Dobbs, who was the younger brother of Arthur Dobbs of Castle
  Dobbs, co. Antrim, formerly Governor of North Carolina. His ancestor, an
  officer in the army, came from England in the reign of Queen Elizabeth;
  and by a marriage with the great-granddaughter of Hugh, Earl of Tyrone,
  got the estate of Castle Dobbs, with other estates in the co. Antrim. His
  great-grandfather was Mayor of Carrickfergus at the time King William
  landed, and was the first subject in Ireland that paid him
  allegiance.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dobbs devoted himself for some years to literary pursuits. In 1768
  he purchased an ensigncy in the 63rd Regiment, in which he continued till
  1773. Having sold his commission, he turned his attention to the study of
  the law, and was called to the bar. He then married Miss Stewart of
  Ballantroy, in the county of Antrim, the daughter of a gentleman of
  considerable property, niece of Sir Hugh Hill, and descended from the
  Bute family. He afterwards joined the <i>Volunteers</i> under Lord
  Charlemont, was appointed Major to the Southern Battalion, and acted as
  exercising officer at the great reviews held at Belfast in 1780, 1781,
  and 1782. He took an active part, in conjunction with Lord Charlemont,
  Mr. Grattan, Mr. Flood, and others, in the political agitation of that
  period; was the mover of an address to the King, approving of the
  proceedings of the Irish Parliament, and was a member of the deputation
  appointed to present it to his Majesty, on which occasion he refused the
  honour of a baronetcy. At a later period, the Earl of Charlemont brought
  him into the Irish Parliament and it was while occupying a seat in that
  assembly, that he delivered the "Speeches" already referred to.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dobbs's Speech on the Legislative Union is one of the most
  remarkable ever pronounced then or since, on that fertile topic. He
  descants in forceful language on the evils, real or imaginary, likely to
  arise from that measure; and points out, with a striking minuteness of
  detail, some of the consequences which have actually resulted therefrom.
  Indeed, the repealers of a subsequent period did little more than borrow
  Mr. Dobbs's language; nor were they able, after thirty years' experience
  of the practical working of the Union, to add a single new grievance to
  the catalogue of those so eloquently expatiated upon by him in the year
  1800. As, however, we have to deal with Mr. Dobbs chiefly as a
  <i>religious</i> prophet, I shall confine my extracts from his speeches
  to the illustration of his character in that capacity.</p>

  <p>The speech on the Legislative Union was delivered on February 5, 1800.
  On June 7 following (the Bill having been carried in the mean time), Mr.
  Dobbs pronounced in the Irish Parliament a speech in which he predicted
  the second coming of the Messiah. This speech, the most extraordinary
  that was ever made in a legislative assembly, presents a singular
  contrast to the sagacity which characterises his political performances.
  A few short extracts will show the change that had come over his
  prophetic vision:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir, from the conduct pursued by administration during this Session,
  and the means that were known to be in their power, it was not very
  difficult to foresee that this Bill must reach that chair. It was not
  very difficult to foresee that it should fall to your lot to pronounce
  the painful words, 'That this bill do pass.' Awful indeed would those
  words be to me, did I consider myself living in ordinary times: but
  feeling as I do that we are not living in ordinary times&mdash;feeling as
  I do that we are living in the most momentous and eventful period of the
  world&mdash;feeling as I do that a new and better order of things is
  about to arise, and that Ireland, in that new order of things, is to be
  highly distinguished indeed&mdash;this bill hath no terrors for me.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I did intend to have gone at some length into history, and the
  sacred predictions; but as I purpose, in a very few months, to give to
  the public a work in which I shall fully express my opinion as to the
  vast design of this terrestrial creation, I shall for the present confine
  myself to such passages as will support three positions:&mdash;The first
  is, the certainty of the second advent of the Messiah; the next, the
  signs of the times of his coming, and the manner of it; and the last,
  that Ireland is to have the glorious pre-eminence of being the first
  kingdom that will receive him."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span></p>

  <p>After dwelling, at some length on his first two positions, he thus
  proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I come now, Sir, to the most interesting part of what I have to say;
  it is to point out my reasons for thinking this is the distinguished
  country in which the Messiah is now to appear. The stone that is to be
  cut out of the mountain without hands, is to fall on the feet of the
  image, and to break the whole image to pieces. Now, that would not be
  true, if Christ and his army was to appear in any country that is a part
  of the image; therefore, all the countries that were comprised in the
  Babylonish and Assyrian empire, in the Medo-Persian empire, in the Greek
  empire, and in the Roman empire, are positively excluded. There is
  another light thrown on this question by a passage in the 41st chapter of
  Isaiah: 'I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come; from the
  rising of the sun shall he call upon my name, and he shall come upon
  princes as upon mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay.' This is
  manifestly the Messiah; and we are therefore to look for a country north
  of Judea, where the prophecy was given. The New World is out of the
  question, being nowhere a subject of prophecy; and as the image is
  excluded, it can only be in the Russian empire, or in the kingdoms of
  Denmark, Sweden, or Ireland.</p>

  <p>"The army that follows the Messiah, we are told, amounts to 144,000;
  and there are a few passages in the Revelation of St. John, that denote
  the place where they are to be assembled. One is, 'I saw them harping
  with their harps.' Another, 'I saw them standing on a sea of glass,
  having the harps of God.' Another is, 'That they were clothed in fine
  linen, white and clean.' Another is, 'And he gathered them together in a
  place, in the Hebrew tongue, called Armageddon.' Now, what respects the
  harp and the fine linen, peculiarly applies to Ireland; and not at all to
  Russia, Denmark, or Sweden. The sea of glass I think must be an island.
  And I believe the word Armageddon in the Hebrew tongue, and Ardmah or
  Armagh in the Irish, mean the same thing. At all events, there is great
  similitude in their sounds; and St. Patrick thought proper to make the
  city of Ardmagh, which is the old name, the seat of the church government
  of Ireland. But besides these sacred passages of Scripture, there are
  some very particular circumstances attending Ireland. She has never had
  her share in worldly prosperity, and has only since 1782 begun to rise;
  and I know no instance in history of any nation beginning to prosper,
  without arriving at a summit of some kind, before it became again
  depressed. The four great empires rose progressively west of each other;
  and Great Britain made the last toe of the image, being the last conquest
  the Romans made in the west. Now, Ireland lies directly west of it, and
  is therefore in exactly the same progressive line, and it never was any
  part of the image, nor did the Roman arms ever penetrate here. The arms
  of Ireland is the harp of David, with an angel in its front. The crown of
  Ireland is the apostolic crown. Tradition has long spoken of it as a land
  of saints; and if what I expect happens, that prediction will be
  fulfilled. But what I rely on more than all, is our miraculous exemption
  from all of the serpent and venomous tribe of reptiles. This appears to
  me in the highest degree emblematic, that Satan, the Great Serpent, is
  here to receive his first deadly blow."</p>

<h3>SIR WALTER SCOTT AND HIS QUOTATIONS FROM HIMSELF.</h3>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">A. J. Dunkin</span> (Vol. viii.,
  p. 622.) asks who was the author of the couplet,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Oh! for a blast of that dread horn,</p>
      <p>On Fontarabian echoes borne."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In reply to which Query you refer him to the juvenile efforts of Frank
  Osbaldiston in the delightful novel of <i>Rob Roy</i>.</p>

  <p>You might have referred him likewise to a corresponding passage in the
  sixth canto of <i>Marmion</i>, sec. xxxiii., from which the accomplished
  poet and novelist repeated <i>inadvertently</i> his own verses:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O for a blast of that <i>dread</i> horn,</p>
      <p>On Fontarabian echoes borne,</p>
      <p class="i1">That to King Charles did come," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I say "inadvertently" from any own knowledge. A few months after the
  well-known occurrence at a public dinner in Edinburgh, when Sir W. Scott
  openly declared himself the author of the <i>Waverley Novels</i>, the
  writer of these lines was staying at Abbotsford on a visit. On one
  occasion, when walking with Sir Walter about his grounds, I led the
  conversation to his late revelations; and while expressing some wonder at
  the length of time during which the secret of the authorship had been
  kept, I ventured to say that I for one had never felt the smallest doubt
  upon the matter, but that the intrinsic evidence of these several works,
  acknowledged and unacknowledged, had long ago convinced me that they were
  written by one and the same author. Among other points I quoted <i>the
  very lines in question</i> from the elegy on the death of the Black
  Prince in <i>Rob Roy</i>, which I reminded Sir Walter might also be found
  in their sixth canto of <i>Marmion</i>. "Ah! indeed," he replied, with
  his natural expression of comic gravity, "that <i>was very careless</i>
  of me! I did not think I should have committed such a blunder!"</p>

  <p>We kept up the like strain of conversation during the whole ramble,
  with a good deal of harmless pleasantry. In the course of our walk Sir
  Walter stopped at a particular point, and leaning on his staff like his
  own "Antiquary," he pointed out some ancient earth-works, whose
  undulating surface indicated the traces of a Roman or Pictish encampment.
  "There," said he, "you <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>will perceive the remains of a very good
  camp." "Yes, Sir," said I, in the words of Lovel, "I do see something
  <i>like a ditch indistinctly marked</i>." Sir Walter burst into a hearty
  fit of laughter, saying, "Ay, my friends do call it the <i>Kairn of
  Kimprunes</i>."</p>

  <p>I trust your readers will forgive me for recording these trivialities;
  but <span class="sc">Mr. Dunkin's</span> Query recalled them to my mind
  so forcibly after the lapse of many years, that I venture to obtrude them
  upon your notice.</p>

  <p>Before I conclude this paper, I may be permitted to make reference to
  a series of letters addressed to Richard Heber, Esq., M.P., by Mr.
  Adolphus, son of the historian of the reign of George III. In the
  conversation referred to, Sir Walter Scott mentioned these letters in
  terms of high approbation,&mdash;terms not undeserved; for a more
  elegant, ingenious, and convincing piece of literary criticism never
  issued from the press.</p>

  <p>At that time I had not seen it; but in reference to the passage in
  question, the coincidence of which in the poem and the romance has not
  escaped the critic's acuteness, Mr. Adolphus makes the following
  remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A refined speculator might perhaps conceive that so glaring a
  repetition could not be the effect of inadvertence, but that the
  novelist, induced by some transient whim or caprice, had intentionally
  appropriated the verses of his great cotemporary. I cannot, however,
  imagine any motive for such a proceeding, more especially as it must
  appear somewhat unhandsome to take possession of another man's lines for
  the mere purpose of exhibiting them in a ridiculous light. Nor does it
  seem to me at all unlikely that the author of <i>Marmion</i>, supposing
  him to be also the author of <i>Rob Roy</i>, should have <i>unconsciously
  repeated himself</i> in this instance, for we find him more than once
  apologising in his avowed works for having, in the haste of composition,
  snatched up expressions, and even whole lines, of other writers."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The anecdote above recorded proves the justice and refinement of the
  critic's speculation.</p>

<h3>THOMAS CAMPBELL.</h3>

  <p>In a small 8vo. volume before me, entitled <i>The History of the
  Stage: in which is included the Theatrical Characters of the most
  celebrated Actors who have adorned the Theatre, &amp;c.; with the
  Theatrical Life of Mr. Colly Cibber</i> (Lond. 1742), I notice a very
  remarkable similarity of thought and expression between its author and
  the late Thomas Campbell. The dramatic author writes thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But with whatever strength of nature we see the poet show at once the
  philosopher and the hero, yet the image of the actor's excellence will
  still be imperfect to you, unless language could put colours into words
  to paint the voice with.</p>

  <p>"The most that a Vandyke can arrive at is to make his portraits of
  great persons seem to think; a Shakspeare goes farther yet, and tells you
  what his picture thought; a Betterton steps beyond them both, and calls
  them from the grave to breathe and be themselves again, in feature,
  speech, and motion. When the skilful actor shows you all these powers at
  once united, and gratifies at once your eye, your ear, your
  understanding,&mdash;to conceive the pleasure arising from such harmony
  you must have been present at it; 'tis not to be told you."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now compare this passage with the following lines from Mr. Campbell's
  "Valedictory Stanzas to J. P. Kemble, Esq.," composed for a public
  meeting held June, 1817:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"His was the spell o'er hearts</p>
      <p class="i1">Which only acting lends,</p>
      <p>The youngest of the Sister Arts,</p>
      <p class="i1">Where all their beauty blends:</p>
      <p>For ill can Poetry express</p>
      <p class="i1">Full many a tone of thought sublime;</p>
      <p>And Painting, mute and motionless,</p>
      <p class="i1">Steals but a glance of time.</p>
      <p>But by the mighty actor brought,</p>
      <p class="i1">Illusion's perfect triumphs come,&mdash;</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Legends of the Co. Clare</i> (Vol. viii., p. 436.).&mdash;The Lake
  of Inchiquin, one legend of which has been already published in "N. &amp;
  Q.," is said to have been once a populous and flourishing city, and still
  on a calm night you may see the towers and spires gleaming through the
  clear wave. But for some dreadful and unabsolved crime, a holy man of
  those days whelmed all beneath the deep waters. The "dark spirit" of its
  king, who ruled also over the surrounding country, resides in a cavern in
  one of the hills which border the lake, and once every seven years at
  midnight, he issues forth mounted on his white charger, and urges him at
  full speed over hill and crag, until he has completed the circuit of the
  lake; and thus he is to continue, till the silver hoofs of his steed are
  worn out, when the curse will be removed, and the city reappear in all
  its splendour. The cave extends nearly a mile under the hill; the
  entrance is low and gloomy, but the roof rises to a considerable height
  for about half the distance, and then sinks down to a narrow passage,
  which leads into a somewhat lower division of the cave. The darkness, and
  the numbers of bats which flap their wings in the face of the explorer,
  and whirl round his taper, fail not to impress him with a sensation of
  awe.</p>

  <p><i>Slow-worm Superstition</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 33. 479.).&mdash;I
  believe that the superstition alluded to is <!-- Page 74 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span>not confined to one
  country, nor to one species of reptile. I remember to have heard some
  countrymen in Cornwall, who had killed an adder, say that it would not
  cease to writhe until the sun had gone down. Like many other so-called
  superstitions, it is probably founded on a close observation of a natural
  phenomenon; and I feel quite sure that I have seen in print, although I
  cannot now call to mind where, that it is to be accounted for by the
  fact, that in these cold-blooded animals the nervous irritability does
  not cease until checked or destroyed by the chilling dews of evening.</p>

<h3>THE VELLUM-BOUND JUNIUS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., pp. 303. 333. 607.; Vol. viii., p. 8.)</p>

  <p>I have no doubt that it will be satisfactory to some of your readers
  to know that I have in my possession a copy, "vellum bound in gilt," of
  <i>Junius</i>, printed for Henry Sampson Woodfall, 1772, 2 vols. This
  copy has been in the family library for about sixty years. There are no
  marks by which it can be traced to its original owner. I imagine it must
  have been purchased by my grandfather, Sir Thomas Metcalfe, after his
  arrival from India about 1788; this is, however, merely a conjecture, in
  default of any more probable theory. Of the authenticity of this copy I
  have no doubt; I mean that it is now in the same condition as when it was
  first issued by the bookseller. The binding is evidently of an old date,
  the gilding is peculiar, and the books correspond exactly with the orders
  of Junius as given to Woodfall in Note No. 47., Dec. 1771, and although
  neatly bound, are, as Woodfall mentions in No. 64., not highly finished.
  Are there many copies of this edition, or may I congratulate myself upon
  possessing <i>the</i> one ordered by Junius? It is quite possible that my
  grandfather possessed this copy some years before his return from India;
  and I may mention that I also have a great many political pamphlets and
  satires, chiefly in poetry, of different dates, from 1760 to 1780, such
  as <i>Catiline's Conspiracy</i>; <i>The Diaboliad</i>; <i>Ditto</i>, with
  additions, dedicated to the worst man in the kingdom (Rigby), and
  containing allusions to all the most celebrated characters of Junius;
  <i>The Senators</i>, <i>La Fête Champêtre</i>, and many miscellanies.
  These, however, are perhaps well known. I have also a pamphlet containing
  an alleged unpublished canto of the <i>Faerie Queene</i> of Spenser, and
  a great many religious tracts from 1580 to 1700. Some of the political
  poems are published by Almon. Among other curious stray sheets, is a list
  of all the gentlemen and officers who fell in the cause of Charles I.,
  and Mr. Richard Brown appears amongst the number. I hope to communicate
  more fully upon some future occasion, and must conclude with an allusion
  to the claims of Francis as the author of <i>Junius</i>. Strong as the
  proofs may be in his favour in England, I believe that in India there is
  testimony no less important; and I have been informed, by one who spoke
  with some authority, that the letters of Francis upon record in this
  country bear no resemblance <i>whatever</i> to those of Junius. This
  assertion, however, is far too vague to satisfy any of your readers. I
  hope some day to be able to confirm it by examples. The India House might

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>The Scotch Grievance.</i>&mdash;Can the demand of Scotchmen, with
  respect to the usage of the royal arms, be justified by the laws of
  Heraldry? I think not. They require that when the royal arms are used in
  Scotland, the Scotch bearings should be placed in the first quarter.
  Surely it is against all rules that the armorial bearings, either of a
  person or of a nation, should be changeable according to the place where
  they are used. The arms of the United Kingdom and of the sovereign are,
  first and fourth, England; second, Scotland; third, Ireland. The Scotch
  have therefore the option of using these, or else the arms of Scotland
  singly; but to shift the quarterings according to locality, seems
  repugnant to the principles of the science. Queen Anne and George I.
  bore, in the first quarter, England impaling Scotland: is it to be
  supposed that, for Scotch purposes, they bore Scotland impaling England?
  Can any <i>coin</i> be produced, from the accession of James VI. to the
  English throne, on which the royal arms are found with Scotland in the
  first quarter and England in the second?</p>

<h3>MR. P. CUNNINGHAME.</h3>

  <p>Can any of your correspondents communicate information respecting a
  Mr. P. Cunninghame, who was employed in the Heralds' Office in the years
  1768-69, and who appears to have left his situation there in order to
  enter the church? Mr. Cunninghame, from a MS. volume of his letters now
  before me, had friends and correspondents of the names of Towne, Dehane,
  Welsh, Cockell, Bawdwen, Wainman, Haggard, Hammond, Neve, Gathorne,
  Innes, Connor, &amp;c., and relations of his own name resided at Deal.
  One of his letters is addressed to his cousin, Captain George
  Cunninghame, General Majoribanks' regiment, in garrison at Tournay,
  Flanders.</p>

  <p>Two gentlemen of the names of Bigland and Heard (probably Sir Isaac
  Heard, who died a few years since at a very advanced age) were his
  superiors in the Heralds' Office at the time of his being there. A former
  possessor of this MS. volume has written in it as follows; and so warm a
  tribute of praise from a distinguished scholar and late member of this
  university, has induced me to send you his remarks, and to make the
  inquiry suggested by them.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I esteem myself fortunate in having purchased this volume of letters,
  which I met with in the shop of Mr. Robins, bookseller, at Winchester, in
  January, 1808. They do credit to the head and the heart of the author. He
  seems to have been a man whose imagination was lively, and whose mind was
  capacious, as well as comprehensive. His remarks on different subjects
  betray reading and reflection. His mental powers, naturally vigorous, he
  appears to have cultivated and improved by as much reading as his
  employments and his agitation of mind would allow. I wish that he had
  committed to this volume some specimens of his poetry, as it would have
  been more than mechanical, or partaking of common-place, for he writes in
  a style at once vigorous, lively, and elegant, and gives proofs of a
  correct taste. He had a manly spirit of independence, a generous
  principle of benevolence and a prevailing habit of piety. The first of
  these qualifications did not in him (as it is too frequently apt to do)
  overleap the bounds of prudence, or the still more binding ties of duty,
  as is exemplified in the excellent letters to his father, and Mr. Dehane.
  It is to be hoped that he entered into that profession from which he was
  so long and so perversely excluded; a profession suited to his genius and
  inclination, which would open an ample field for his benevolence, and
  which would receive additional lustre from the example of so much virtue
  and so much industry exerted in the cause of truth. It is to be hoped
  that he gained that competence and retirement to which the wishes of the
  interested reader must follow him, regretting that he knows not more of a
  man, who, from those amiable dispositions and those eminent talents,
  pourtrayed in this correspondence, would indeed&mdash;</p>

<h3>WAS SHAKSPEARE DESCENDED FROM A LANDED PROPRIETOR?</h3>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Knight</span> has on two occasions, the latter in
  his <i>Stratford Shakspeare</i> just published, called attention to what
  he concludes is an oversight of mine in not drawing any conclusion from a
  deed in which certain lands are mentioned as "heretofore <i>the
  inheritance</i> of William Shakspeare, Gent., deceased." These words are
  supposed by <span class="sc">Mr. Knight</span> to imply that the lands in
  question came to Shakspeare by descent, as heir-at-law of his father.
  This opinion appeared to me to be somewhat a hasty one: believing that no
  conclusion whatever is to be drawn from the phrase as there used, and
  relying on the ordinary definition of <i>inheritance</i> in the old works
  on law, I did not hesitate, some time since, to declare a conviction that
  the lands so mentioned were bought by Shakspeare himself. As the question
  is of some importance in the inquiry respecting the position of the
  poet's ancestry, perhaps one of your legal readers would kindly decide
  which of us is in the right. I possess an useful collection of old
  law-books, but there are few subjects in which error is so easily
  committed by unprofessional readers. In the present instance, however, if
  plain words are to be relied upon, it seems certain that the term
  <i>inheritance</i> was applied, to use Cowell's words, to <!-- Page 76
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>"every fee
  simple or fee taile that a man hath by his purchase." (See <i>The

<h3>QUEEN ELIZABETH AND QUEEN ANNE'S MOTTO.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 174. 255. 440.)</p>

  <p>I was not aware that the Query at page 174. was not fully answered by
  me in page 255., but the following may be more satisfactory.</p>

  <p>Camden, in his Life of Queen Elizabeth (<i>Annals of Queen
  Elizabeth</i>, p. 32.), says her first and chiefest care was for the most
  constant defence of the Protestant religion as established by the
  authority of parliament. "Her second care to hold an even course in her
  whole life and in all her actions, whereupon she took for her motto
  (1559), <i>Semper eadem</i> (Always the same)."</p>

  <p>In his <i>Remains</i> (p. 347. 4to. 1637), Camden says, "Queen
  Elizabeth upon occasions used so many heroical devices as would require a
  volume: but most commonly a sive without a motte for her words
  <i>Video</i>, <i>Taceo</i>, and <i>Semper eadem</i>, which she as truly
  and constantly performed."</p>

  <p>Sandford is silent as to her motto.</p>

  <p>Leake says this motto, <i>Semper eadem</i>, was only a personal motto;
  as queen, the old motto, <i>Dieu et mon Droit</i>, was used, and is so
  given in Segar's <i>Honour, Military and Civil</i>, dedicated to her
  majesty in 1602, and which is also on her tomb. In some churches where
  there are arms put up to her memory, it is probable the motto <i>Semper
  eadem</i> may sometimes have been seen as being a personal motto to
  distinguish it from her brothers. Queen Anne, before the union with
  Scotland, bore the same arms, crest, and supporters as her father King
  James II., but discontinued the use of the old motto, <i>Dieu et mon
  Droit</i>, and instead thereof used <i>Semper eadem</i>. The motto
  ascribed to Queen Elizabeth she took for the same reason to express her
  constancy; but this, which was personal as to Queen Elizabeth, was then
  made the motto of the royal achievement, and seems the first instance of
  discontinuing the old motto of <i>Dieu et mon Droit</i>, from the first
  assumption of it by King Edward III.; for as to the different ones
  attributed to Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, and King James I., they were
  personal only.</p>

  <p>The motto is indeed no part of the arms but personal, and therefore is
  frequently varied according to the fancy of the bearer; nevertheless,
  when particular mottoes have been taken to perpetuate the memory of great
  events, either in families or kingdoms, and have been established by long
  usage, such should be esteemed as family or national mottoes, and it is
  honourable to continue them.</p>

  <p>In 1702 (<i>Gazette</i>, No. 3874) Queen Anne commanded the Earl
  Marshal to signify her pleasure that wheresoever her royal arms were to
  be used with a motto, that of <i>Semper eadem</i> should be used; and
  upon the union with Scotland in 1707, by her order in council it was
  ordered to be continued.</p>

  <p>King George I., upon his accession, thought proper to discontinue it,
  and restored the old motto, <i>Dieu et mon Droit</i>.</p>

<h3>BOOKS BURNT BY THE COMMON HANGMAN.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 272. 346.)</p>

  <p>The <i>Histoires</i> of Theodore Agrippa d'Aubigné were condemned, by
  an arrêt of the parliament of Paris, to be burnt by the common hangman.
  The charge against the works was, that D'Aubigné had spoken too freely of
  princes; and it may be added, too freely also of the Jesuits, which was
  probably the greatest crime. D'Aubigné said upon the occasion, that he
  could not be offended at the treatment given to his book, after having
  seen the Holy Bible ignominiously hanged upon a gibbet (for thus some
  fiery zealots used the Bible which had taken from the Huguenots, to show
  their pious hatred to all translations of that book into their native
  tongue), and fourscore thousand innocent persons massacred without
  provocation.</p>

  <p>The <i>Histoire</i> of James Augustus de Thou (a Roman Catholic,
  though a moderate one) met with the same fate at Rome that D'Aubigné's
  had at Paris, and it was even debated in council whether the like
  sentence should not pass against it in France. D'Aubigné, however, spoke
  strongly in its favour, affirming that no Frenchman had ever before given
  such evident proofs of solid <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span>judgment and steady application, qualities
  not generally allowed to be the characteristic of the nation. (Scott's
  <i>Life of Theodore Agrippa d'Aubigné</i>, p. 419.)</p>

  <p>In 1762 the <i>Emilie</i> of Jean Jacques Rousseau was burnt at Geneva
  by the common hangman. <i>Le Contrat Social</i> had soon afterwards the
  same fate. (<i>Biographie Universelle</i>, article "J. J. Rousseau.")</p>

  <p>On June 17th, 1553, nearly the whole of the edition of the <i>De
  Christianismi Restitutione</i> of Servetus, which had been seized at
  Lyons, was cast into the flames, and Servetus burnt in effigy at Vienne
  in Dauphiné. (<i>Biographie Universelle</i>, art. "Servetus.")</p>

  <p>In 1538 the English Bible, printed by Grafton at Paris, was (with the
  exception of a few copies) burnt by the order of the Inquisition. During
  the reign of Henry VIII. (observes Mr. D'Israeli in <i>Amenities of
  Literature</i>, vol. iii. p. 358.), the Bishop of Durham had all the
  unsold copies of Tindal's Testament bought up at Antwerp and burnt. In
  this age of unsettled opinions, both Roman Catholic and Protestant books
  were burnt. In the reign of Edward VI. Roman Catholic works fed the
  flames.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"All red-lettered illuminated volumes were chopped in pieces with
  hatchets, and burned as superstitious. The works of Peter Lombard, Duns
  Scotus, and Thomas Aquinas, carried on biers, were tumbled into bonfires.
  In the reign of Mary pyramids of Protestant volumes were burnt. All the
  Bibles in English, and all the commentators upon the Bible in the
  vernacular idiom (which we are told from their number seemed almost
  infinite), were cast into the flames at the market-place,
  Oxford."&mdash;D'Israeli's <i>Amenities of Literature</i>, vol. ii. pp.

  for a <i>rebel</i>."</p>

  <p>The Stationers' Company (who were granted a charter of incorporation
  during the reign of Philip and Mary) had power to seize, take away, and
  burn books which they deemed obnoxious to the state or to their own
  interests.</p>

<h3>STONE PULPITS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., p. 562.)</p>

  <p>To <span class="sc">Mr. Kersley's</span> list I can add, from my own
  county, St. John the Evangelist, Cirencester, used; SS. Peter and Paul,
  Northleach, used; Staunton, All Saints, in the Hundred of St. Briavell's,
  Dean Forest, not used.</p>

  <p>The last has a curious double arrangement in two storeys, like a
  modern reading-desk and pulpit, projecting west from the north side of
  the chancel arch, or rather (if I recollect rightly, for I took no notes
  on visiting the church) of the west tower arch, and to both which there
  is access from the newel leading to the ancient rood-loft.</p>

  <p>To the above might be added those of Coombe, Oxon; Frampton, Dorset;
  and Trinity Church, Coventry: and if any other than those in churches,
  the angular one in the entrance court in Magdalene College, Oxford, from
  which, formerly, the University Sermon used to be preached on the
  festival of St. John the Baptist, when the court was strewed with rushes
  for the occasion (vide <i>Glossary of Architecture</i>, in verb.); that
  in the refectory of Tinterne Abbey, Monmouthshire; and the well-known
  exquisite specimen of the later First Pointed period, occupying a similar
  locality in the Abbey of Beaulieu, Hants, so elaborately illustrated by
  Mr. Carter in Weale's <i>Quarterly Papers</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Brookthorpe.</span></p>

  <p>A collection of English examples alone would make a long list. Besides
  the well-known one (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1480) in the outer court
  of Magdalene College, Oxford, the following are noted in the last edition
  of the Oxford <i>Glossary</i>, viz:&mdash;Beaulieu, Hants (<span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1260); Beverley; Chester; Abbey Garden,
  Shrewsbury: these are in refectories of monasteries. In churches&mdash;at
  Cirencester; Coombe, Oxon (circa <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1370);
  Frampton, Dorset (circa <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1450); Trinity
  Church, Coventry (circa <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1470): the latter
  appears from the cut to be stone.</p>

  <p>In the second edition of the <i>Glossary</i> is also St. Peter's, Oxon
  (circa 1400).</p>

  <p>Devonshire abounds in good samples: see <i>Trans. of Exeter
  Architectural Society</i>, vol. i., at table of plates, and the engraved
  plates of three very rich specimens, viz. Harberton, Chittlehampton,
  North Molton, each of which is encircled by canopied niches with
  statues.</p>

  <p>At North Petherton, in Somersetshire, is a curious grotesque human
  figure of stone, crouched on the floor, supporting the pulpit (which is
  of wood, as I think) upon his shoulders, Atlas-like.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Kersley</span> desires a list of ancient stone

<h3>ANTIQUITY OF FIRE-IRONS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., p. 587.)</p>

  <p>The invention of these domestic instruments, called "tongs,
  fireshovels, and prongs" by Sir T. Browne, dates from a very early
  period. The "shovel" is the A.-S. <i>fyr-sceofl</i>. Lye refers to "the
  fire-sholve" of the sixteenth century, which he tells us was "made like a
  grate to sift the sea-cole with," exactly as we see it constructed now
  (See Gage's <i>Hengrave</i>, p. 23.) The "poker" (see Du Cange, v.
  <i>Titionarium</i>) is mentioned by Johan. de Januâ in the thirteenth
  century. It had formerly two massive prongs, and was commonly called the
  "fire-fork." There is a poker of this description, temp. Hen. VIII., in
  Windsor Castle, which is figured in Britton's <i>Archit. Antiq.</i>, vol.
  ii. p. 99. (See also Strutt's <i>Horda Angelcynn</i>, vol. ii, pp. 62.
  64., and Fosbrooke's <i>Encyc. Antiq.</i>, pp. 264. 305. 340.) The
  "tongs," A.-S. <i>fyr-tang</i> (see Du Cange, v. <i>Tenalea</i>,
  <i>Tenales</i>, <i>Tenecula</i>), with which Swift mischievously directs
  us to stir the fire "if the poker be out of the way," are of the remotest
  antiquity. They are frequently spoken of in the sacred records, as by
  Isaiah, vi. 6.; and we all know to what purpose a similar weapon was
  applied by holy St. Dunstan. In fact, they are doubtless coeval with
  fires themselves. The word "tongs" is the old Icelandic, Norræna, or
  Dönsktúnga, <i>taung</i>, pl. <i>tángir</i>, the Dan. <i>tang</i>, Scot.
  and Belg. <i>tangs</i>, <i>taings</i>, Belg. <i>tanghe</i>, Alem.
  <i>zanga</i>, Germ. <i>zange</i>, Gall. <i>tenaille</i>, Ital.
  <i>tenaglia</i>, &amp;c. The most ancient of the mytho-cosmogonic poems
  of the elder Edda attribute to this implement an origin no less than
  divine; for in the <i>Völo-spa</i>, st. vii., it is stated that when the
  mighty &OElig;sir assembled on Idavöllr to regulate the courses of the
  stars, to take counsel for the erection of temples and palaces, and to
  build furnaces, amongst other tools, by them also then fabricated,
  <i>tángir scópo</i>, "they made tongs," for the use and delectation of
  the <i>völundr à járn</i>, or skilful blacksmith (the Weyland smith of
  "Kenilworth") and careful housewife of future days.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Wm. Matthews.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Cowgill.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Aliquis</span> will perhaps find his question
  satisfactorily answered by a visit to Goodrich Court, Herefordshire,
  where the late Sir Samuel Meyrick, with the industry and exactness which
  distinguished that indefatigable antiquary, had arranged a series of
  rooms illustrative of the domestic habits of the twelfth, thirteenth,
  fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries.</p>

  <p>It is so long ago since I saw these rooms (and then but very
  cursorily), that I will not undertake to say the series was complete from
  the twelfth inclusive; and when, recently, last there, the family were at
  home, and nothing but the armoury shown; but from the evident care taken
  of that unrivalled and magnificent collection by the present proprietor,
  the series of appropriate furniture, each <i>genuine</i> specimens of the
  period they represent, is doubtless preserved intact, though I understood
  that the chambers had been since fitted up more consistently with the
  requirements of the nineteenth century.</p>

<h3>ORDER OF ST. JOHN OF JERUSALEM.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 407.)</p>

  <p>R. L. P. asks "What members of the British language were present,
  when, in 1546, the English commander Upton attacked and defeated the
  famous corsair Dragut at Tarschien, in Malta?" <!-- Page 81 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>{81}</span></p>

  <p>In answer to the above question I would beg to remark, that in
  September, 1536, John d'Omedes ascended the Maltese throne on the decease
  of Didier de Saint Jaille; and his reign continued seventeen years, <i>i.
  e.</i> to 1553. In looking through several histories of the order, I am
  unable to find any mention made of a Turkish descent on the island in
  1546. Had such an occurrence taken place, it doubtless would have been
  recorded; but as it is not, it would have been impossible for the
  Commander Upton to have distinguished himself in any such conflict as
  your correspondent supposes.</p>

  <p>R. L. P. then asks, "What members of it were present (that is, the
  British language) when the Chevalier Repton, Grand Prior of England in
  1551, was killed, after signally defeating the Turks in another attack on
  the island?"</p>

  <p>With all due deference I would beg to state, that there was not in
  July, 1551, when Dragut made an attack on Malta, any English knight of
  the name of Repton; and it can be satisfactorily shown by the following
  extract, that at the period referred to by R. L. P., Nicholas Upton was
  Grand Prior of England, and <i>was not</i> "killed" after signally
  defeating the Turks, but died from the effects of a <i>coup de
  soleil</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"L'isola del Gozzo fu presa da Sinam Bassa, a persuasione di Dragutte,
  il 1551, essendosi renduto a discrezione F. Galaziano de Sesse Aragonese,
  Governatore, che vi rimase schiavo. Ma poco dopo il Cavaliere F. Pietro
  d'Olivares, la ristaurò da danni patiti e vi richiamò nuove famiglie a
  ripopolarla. Sinam, prima di andare al Gozzo, fece una discesa in Malta,
  ma fu rispinto da Cavaliere: <i>nella quale azione pel molto caldo
  sofferto, mori Nicolas Vpton, Gran Priore d'Inghilterra.</i>"&mdash;Vide
  <i>Codice Dip.</i>, vol. ii. p. 573.; as also Vertot's <i>History of the
  Order</i>, vol. iv. p. 144., date July, 1551.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That Sir Nicholas Upton was Grand Prior of England in 1551, is
  sufficiently shown in the above extract; and that <i>he was</i> Commander
  of Repton, or Ripston, will be as readily seen by the following lines
  translated from the Latin, and to be found in a book of manuscripts of
  the years 1547, 1548, 1549, now in the Record Office. (Vide Lib. Bull. M.
  M. F. J. Homedes.)</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On the 15th November, 1547, Nicholas Upton was appointed by the Grand
  Master Omedes Commander of Ripston in the language of England. And on the
  5th of November, 1548, he was exalted to the dignity of Turcopolier, in
  place of the knight Russell deceased."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I am unable to inform R. L. P. what English knights were present in
  Malta in 1551; but enough has already appeared in "N. &amp; Q." to show
  that they were few in number, and poor as regards their worldly effects.
  The Reformation had destroyed the British language, and caused the ruin
  of its members. The first severe blow against the Order of St. John of
  Jerusalem was given by Henry VIII., and the last by Queen Elizabeth in
  the first year of her reign. (Vide "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. viii., pp. 189.

<h3>DERIVATION OF MAWMET.&mdash;CAME.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 468. 515.)</p>

  <p>That the word <i>mawmet</i> is a derivation from the name of Mahomet,
  is rendered exceedingly probable by two circumstances taken in connexion:
  its having been in common use to signify an idol, in the age immediately
  following that of the Crusades; and the fact, that in the public opinion
  and phraseology of that time, a Saracen and an idolater were synonymous.
  In the metrical romances of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
  Mahometanism is described as "hethenesse," and Saracens as "paynims,"
  "heathens," and "folks of the heathen law." The objects of their faith
  and worship were supposed to be Mahomet, Jupiter, Apollo, Pluto, and
  Termagaunt. Thus, in the romance of <i>Richard C&oelig;ur de
  Lion</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"They slowe euery Sarezyn,</p>
      <p>And toke the temple of Apolyn."&mdash;L. 4031-2.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That we our God Mahoun forsake."&mdash;L. 4395.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And made ther her (their) sacryfyse,</p>
      <p>To Mahoun, and to Jupiter."&mdash;L. 4423.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But to Termagaunt and Mahoun,</p>
      <p>They cryede fast, and to Plotoun."&mdash;L. 6421-2.</p>
      <p class="i8">Weber's <i>Metrical Romances</i>, vol. ii.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The editor says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is no doubt that our romance existed before the year 1300, as
  it is referred to in the <i>Chronicles of Robert de Gloucester and Robert
  de Brunne</i>."&mdash;Vol. i. Introd., p. xlvi.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the same poem, the word <i>mawmettes</i> is used to signify
  idols:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sarazynes before hym <i>came</i>,</p>
      <p>And asked off hym Crystendame.</p>

      <p class="i16">L. 5829-44.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In Wiclif's translation of the New Testament also, the word occurs in
  the same sense: <i>mawmetis</i>, <i>idolis</i>, and <i>false goddis</i>
  being used indifferently where <i>idola</i> or <i>simulacra</i> are
  employed in the Latin Vulgate: thus&mdash;</p>

  the usual expressions answering to "came" in our translation. If above
  five hundred and fifty years' possession does not give a word a good

<h3>THE GOSLING FAMILY.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 510.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">One of the Flock</span> asks for information relative
  to the antiquity of the name and family of Gosling. The Norman name of
  Gosselin is evidently the same as that of Jocelyn, the tendency of the
  Norman dialect being to substitute a hard <i>g</i> for the <i>j</i> or
  soft <i>g</i>, as <i>gambe</i> for <i>jambe</i>, <i>guerbe</i> for
  <i>gerbe</i>. As a family name it is far from uncommon in Normandy, and
  many of your antiquarian readers may recognise it as the name of a
  publisher at Caen of works on the antiquities of that province. A family
  of the name of Gosselin has been established for many centuries in the
  island of Guernsey. William Gocelyn was one of those sworn upon the
  inquest as to the services, customs, and liberties of the island, and the
  laws established by King John, which inquest was confirmed by King Henry
  III. in the year 1248. In the year 1331 an extent of the crown revenues,
  &amp;c. was made by order of Edward III., and in this document the name
  of Richard Gosselin appears as one of the jury of the parish of St.
  Peter-Port.</p>

  <p>A genealogy of the Guernsey family of Gosselin is to be found in the
  appendix to Berry's history of that island, and it is there stated
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The first on record in Jersey is Robert Gosselin, who greatly
  assisted in rescuing the castle of Mont Orgueil from the French in the
  reign of Edward III., and was, for his gallant services, not only
  appointed governor of the castle by that monarch, but presented with the
  arms since borne by that family (viz. Gules, a <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>chevron between three
  crescents ermine), as appears by the original grant under the great seal
  of England, supposed to be upon record in the Tower of London, or among
  the archives at Winchester. This Robert Gosselin some time after settled
  in Guernsey, where he married Magdelaine, daughter of William Maltravers,
  his majesty's lieutenant in that island."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On referring to Burke's <i>Armory</i>, I find that families of the
  name of Gosselin, Gosling, and Gooseling all bear arms similar to those
  described above, or but slightly differing, which affords a strong
  presumption that they are all descended from the same stock. The arms of
  Gosselin of Normandy are quite different.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Tent for Collodion Purposes.</i>&mdash;Some time ago, I saw in "N.
  &amp; Q." a slight notice of a tent for the collodion process: I think it
  is called "Francis' Collodion Tent." Would you, or some of your
  photographic correspondents, oblige me by giving a short description of
  this tent, or any other form, so that I may be able to operate with
  collodion in the open air?</p>

  <p>I am of an opinion, with a portable tent, so that we could expose
  paper in a damp state, the process might be done nearly as quick as
  collodion. All that need be done for a paper negative, would be to expose
  and develop; it can be fixed at home. But after being developed, it
  should be well washed and dried.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">James O. Clazey.</span></p>

  <p><i>Multiplying Negatives and Collodion on Paper.</i>&mdash;As I am
  desirous of printing a large quantity of copies of a glass negative in my
  possession, I shall be obliged by any hints as to the best method of
  multiplying such negative, so as to guard against an accident from
  breakage.</p>

  <p>I should also feel obliged for any hints upon the use of collodion
  applied to glass, paper intervening; so that the paper may be afterwards
  removed from the glass, and used as a negative. I have heard of much
  success in this way, but am at a loss to know the best mode of
  operation.</p>

  <p><i>Photographic Copies of Ancient Manuscripts.</i>&mdash;Might not
  photography be well employed in making facsimiles of valuable, rare, and
  especially of unique ancient manuscripts? If copies of such manuscripts
  could be multiplied at a moderate price, there are many proprietors of
  libraries would be glad to enrich them by what, for all purposes of
  reference, would answer equally well with the originals.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[This subject, which has already been touched upon in our columns, has
  not yet received the attention it deserves. We have now before us a
  photographic copy of a folio page of a MS. of the fourteenth or fifteenth
  century, on which are inscribed a number of charters; and, although the
  copy is reduced so as to be but about 2 inches high and 1½ broad, it is
  perfectly legible; and the whole of the contractions are as distinct as

  <p><i>Fox Talbot's Patents.</i>&mdash;Would the Editor of "N. &amp; Q."
  have the kindness to inform A. B. whether a photograph (portrait), taken
  from a <i>black cutting</i> made by an amateur, and inserted in a
  published work, would infringe on Mr. F. Talbot's patent? Also, whether
  collodion portraits come within his patent, as it was understood it could
  only apply to the <i>paper process</i>? (The cutting would be taken on
  albumenised paper.)</p>

  <p>A. B. would also be glad to know <i>where</i> Towgood of St. Neot's
  <i>positive</i> paper can be procured, and the price?</p>

  <p class="author">A. B.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fox Talbot having thrown open the whole of his patents,&mdash;with
  the exception of the taking of portraits for sale, on which it is
  understood that gentleman claims a royalty which may, in some cases, be
  considered a prohibition,&mdash;I should be glad to know under which of
  Mr. Talbot's patents such royalty can be enforced, and when the patent in
  question expires?</p>

  <p><i>Antiquarian Photographic Society.</i>&mdash;We believe that most of
  the difficulties which have stood in the way of the organisation of this
  Society have at length been got over; and that we shall, in the course of
  a week or two, be enabled to state full particulars of its rules,
  arrangements, &amp;c. Our readers are aware that its main object is the
  interchange of photographs among the members; each contributing as many
  copies of his own work as there are members of the Society, and receiving
  in exchange as many different photographs, Thus, if the Society is
  limited to twenty-five or fifty members, each member will have to furnish
  twenty-five or fifty copies, as the case may be, of the photograph he
  presents to the Society; and, in return, will receive one photograph from
  each of his fellow members. The difficulty, or rather trouble of
  printing, must necessarily limit the number of members; and as a
  consequence will, we doubt not, lead to the formation of many similar
  associations.</p>

  <p><i>Nattochiis and Calchanti</i> (Vol. ix., p. 36.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent F.S.A. asks what "cum g<sup>a</sup>nis et nattochiis"
  means, in a charter of the date of Edward II. At that time <i>nattes</i>
  signified reeds, and possibly <i>withies</i>: and the words quoted I
  believe to mean, "with all grass and reeds (or reed-beds)." He also
  inquires what is meant, in a deed of grant of the time of Queen
  Elizabeth, by a grant of "decimas calchanti," &amp;c.? It signifies
  "tithes ways," &amp;c. The original law Latin for the modern phrase "all
  ways," &amp;c., was <i>calceata</i>, signifying "raised ways."</p>

  <p>This word has (at different periods) been written, <i>calceata</i>,
  <i>calcata</i>, <i>calcea</i>, <i>calchia</i>, <i>chaucée</i>, and

  <p><i>Marriage Ceremony in the Fourteenth Century</i> (Vol. ix., p.
  33.).&mdash;If R. C. will refer to Palmer's <i>Origines Liturgicæ</i>
  (Rivington, 1845, vol. ii. p. 214.), he will find that the first part of
  the matrimonial office was "anciently termed the <i>espousals</i>, which
  took place some time <i>before</i> the actual celebration of marriage."
  Palmer explains:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The espousals consisted in a mutual <i>promise</i> of marriage, which
  was made by the man and woman before the bishop or presbyter, and several
  witnesses. After which, the articles of agreement of marriage (called
  <i>tabulæ matrimoniales</i>), which are mentioned by Augustin, were
  signed by both persons. After this, <i>the man delivered to the woman the
  ring and other gifts</i>; an action which was termed <i>subarrhation</i>.
  In the latter ages the espousals have always been performed at the same
  time as the office of matrimony, both in the western and eastern
  churches; and <i>it has long been customary</i> for the ring to be
  delivered to the woman <i>after the contract has been made</i>, which has
  always been in the actual office of matrimony."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Wheatly also speaks of the <i>ring</i> as a "token of
  <i>spousage</i>." He tell us that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the old manual for the use of Salisbury, before the minister
  proceeds to the marriage, he is directed <i>to <!-- Page 85 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>ask the woman's
  dowry</i>, viz. <i>the tokens of spousage: and by these tokens of
  spousage are to be understood rings, or money, or some other things to be
  given to the woman by the man; which said giving is called
  subarration</i> (i. e. wedding or covenanting), <i>especially when it is
  done by the giving of a ring.</i>"&mdash;<i>A Rational Illustration of
  the Book of Common Prayer, &amp;c.</i> (Tegg, 1845), p. 408.</p>

  <p><i>Clarence</i> (Vol. viii., p. 565.).&mdash;I made no note of it at
  the time, but I remember to have read, I think in some newspaper
  biography of William IV., that the title of Clarence belonged to the
  Plantagenets in right of some of their foreign alliances, and that it was
  derived from the town of Chiarenza, or Clarence, in the Morea. As many of
  the crusaders acquired titles of honour from places in the Byzantine
  empire, this account may be correct. Lionel Plantagenet's acquisition of
  the honour of <i>Clare</i> by his marriage with Elizabeth de Burgh, may
  have induced his father Edward III. to revive the dormant title of
  <i>Clarence</i> in his favour.</p>

  <p><i>Henry Earl of Wotton</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 173. 281. 563.).&mdash;In
  reply to the editors of the <i>Navorscher</i> I have to state&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. That neither of the Lords Stanhope mentioned died childless, the
  letters <i>s. p.</i> being a misprint for <i>v. p.</i> (<i>vitâ
  patris</i>); Henry having died during the lifetime of his father: and it
  was "in regard that he did not live to enjoy his father's honours" that
  his widow was afterwards advanced to the dignity of Countess of
  Chesterfield.</p>

  <p>2. It was Charles Stanhope's nephew (of the half-blood), Charles Henry
  van der Kerckhove, who took the name of Wotton. The insertion of the word
  "thereupon" between "who" and "took," on p. 281., would have made the
  sentence less obscure.</p>

  <p>3. Philip, first Earl of Chesterfield, had, besides Henry Lord
  Stanhope, two daughters and ten sons. These were&mdash;John, who died a
  student at Oxford; Ferdinando, M.P. for Tamworth, 1640, killed at
  Bridgeford, Notts, 1643; Philip, killed in defence of his father's house,
  which was a garrison for the king, 1645; Arthur, youngest son, M.P. for
  Nottingham in the parliament of Charles II., from whom descended the
  fifth earl; Charles, died <i>s. p.</i> 1645; Edward, William, Thomas,
  Michael, George, died young.</p>

  <p>The earldom descended in a right line for three generations to the
  issue of Henry, Lord Stanhope, viz. Philip, his son, second earl; Philip,
  third earl, his grandson; and Philip, fourth earl, his
  great-grandson.</p>

  <p>The Alexander Stanhope mentioned by the editors of the
  <i>Navorscher</i> was the only son of Philip, first Earl of Chesterfield,
  by his second marriage. His mother was Anne, daughter of Sir John
  Pakington, of Westwood, co. Worcester, ancestor of the present baronet,

  "Blue Anchor?" I have always understood that the sign of the Bell,
  painted blue, was intended as a substitute for the little Scotch flower
  bearing the name of the <i>blue-bell</i>. I believe it is either the blue
  flower of the flax, or that of the wild blue hyacinth, which in shape
  much resembles a bell. It was probably much easier to draw the metallic
  figure than the flower, and hence its use by the primitive village
  artists. As to the "Blue Anchor," the anchor is the well-known symbol of
  Hope, and blue her emblematic colour. Hence this adaptation is less a
  solecism than that of the bell for the hyacinth.</p>

  376.).&mdash;The portrait of Sir Anthony Wingfield, "with the hand on the
  girdle," was, a few years ago, in the collection of Dawson Turner, Esq.,
  at Yarmouth. A private etching of it was made by Mrs. Turner. The
  original was rescued from among the Letheringham pictures at Ashmans,
  where they appear to have been sadly neglected.</p>

  <p>The late Robert Rede, Esq., whose father, Thomas Rede, purchased of
  Sir Edwin Rich, Bart., in 1805, the manor of Rose Hall and Ashmans,
  erected upon that estate the mansion called <i>Ashmans</i>. The place is
  not styled Ashmans <i>Park</i>, nor does its extent warrant such a
  designation.</p>

  <p>This property, on the death of Mr. Robert Rede in 1822, passed to the
  late Rev. Robert Rede Cooper, who assumed the surname of Rede; and on his
  death, without male issue, the estate devolved upon his four daughters,
  Louisa Charlotte, wife of Francis Fowke, Esq.; Anne Cooper, wife of
  Robert Orford Buckley, Esq.; Mary Anne Sarah Bransby, wife of Charles
  Henry Tottenham, Esq.; and Miss Madeline Naunton Leman Rede. The property
  has not been sold. Its most interesting antiquarian feature is the old
  house called Rose (or more properly Roos) Hall, which belonged
  successively to the Colly, Suckling, Rich, and finally the Rede,
  families.</p>

  <p>The pictures which remained at Ashmans were removed from thence within
  the last year; but whether any of those from the Letheringham gallery
  were among them, I know not.</p>

  <p><i>Derivation of the Word "Celt"</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 344.
  651.).&mdash;Job xix. 24. In the Cologne (Ely) edition of the Vulgate,
  1679, the word is <i>Celt</i>. In Mareschal's Bible (Ludg. 1525), the
  word in the text is <i>Celte</i>, but the marginal note is
  "al<sup>s</sup> <i>Certe</i>." In the Louvain (or Widen's) Bible (Antw.,
  apud Viduam et Hæredes Joannis Stelsii, 1572, cum priv.), the word in the
  text is <i>Certé</i>. This latter being an authorised edition of the
  Vulgate, it seems probable that <i>Celté</i>, or <i>Celt</i>, must have
  been an error.</p>

  correspondent J. S. A. has mentioned under the above head the worship of
  "gods," as he calls their pictures or images, by the Russians. I am sure
  he will find no such name or meaning given to them by the Russians in
  their writings; for an account of what they really believe and teach I
  would refer him to Mouravieff's <i>History of the Russian Church</i>;
  <i>The Catechism of the Russian Church Translated</i>; <i>Harmony of
  their Doctrine with that of the English Church</i>; all translated by Mr.
  Blackmore, late Chaplain to the Russian Company.</p>

  <p><i>French Translation of the "London Gazette"</i> (Vol. vi., p.
  223.).&mdash;A correspondent describes a French edition of the <i>London
  Gazette</i>, which he had met with of the date of May 6, 1703; and
  considering it as a curiosity, he wishes some reader would give an
  account of it. It has occurred to me to meet with a similar publication,
  which <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page87"></a>{87}</span>appeared twenty years antecedent to the time
  above specified. It is entitled <i>La Gazette de Londres, publiée avec
  Privilège, depuis le Jeudi 11, jusqu'au Lundi 15, Mai, 1682 (vieux
  style)</i>, No. 1621. It gives a very circumstantial detail of the loss
  of the "Gloucester" frigate, near the mouth of the Humber, in the night
  of Friday, May 5, 1682, when she was conveying the Duke of York (postquam
  James II.) to Scotland. Sir John Berry, who commanded the vessel, managed
  to remove the duke to another ship; but the Earl of Roxburgh, Lord
  O'Brien, the Laird of Hopetoun, Sir Joseph Douglas, Mr. Hyde (Lord
  Clarendon's brother), several of the duke's servants, and about 130
  seamen, were lost in the "Gloucester." The pilot was either deficient in
  skill, or obstinate, and was to be brought to trial.<a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With regard to the reason of publishing a French version of the
  <i>Gazette</i>, might it not be judged expedient (as the French was then
  spoken in every Court in Europe, and the English language almost unknown
  out of the British dominions) to publish this translation in French for
  foreign circulation? It is to be remarked that the copy I have met with
  is styled <i>privileged</i>?</p>

  saying was used prior to the time of Thomas à Kempis; but in adding that
  it did not originate with the author of the <i>De Imitatione</i>, your

  John Gerson, a Benedictine Monk, between the years 1220 and 1240; and
  afterwards Abbat of the monastery of St. Stephen. (Vide <i>De Imit. curâ
  Joh. Hrabiéta</i>, 1847, Præfat., viii. et seq.)</p>

  <p>Can any of your correspondents give other early quotations from the

  <p><i>General Whitelocke</i> (Vol. viii., p. 621.).&mdash;In reply to G.
  L. S., I well remember this unfortunate officer residing at Clifton, near
  Bristol, up to about the year 1826; but as I then removed to a distant
  part of the kingdom, I cannot say where the rest of his life was spent.
  Although I was then but young, the lapse of years has not effaced from my
  memory the melancholy gloom of his countenance. If the information G. L.
  S. is seeking should be of importance, I cannot but think he may obtain
  it on the traces which have been given him. To which I may add, that up
  to a late period a son of the General, who was brought up to the church,
  held a living near Malton, Yorkshire; indeed, I believe he still holds
  it.</p>

  <p>D. N.'s information, that General Whitelocke fixed his residence in
  <i>Somersetshire</i>, may probably be correct; but it has occurred to me
  as just possible that Clifton was the place pointed to, inasmuch as it is
  a vulgar error, almost universal, that Bristol (of which Clifton may now
  be said to be merely the <i>west end</i>) is in Somersetshire; whereas
  the fact is, that the greater part of that city, and the whole of
  Clifton, are on the Gloucestershire side of the Avon, there the boundary
  between the two counties.</p>

  <p>I may mention, that in a late number of <i>Tait's Magazine</i>, there
  was a tale, half fiction and half fact, but evidently meant to appear the
  latter, in which the narrator states that he was in the ranks in General
  Whitelocke's army; and in that fatal affair, in which he was engaged, the
  soldiers found that the flints had been removed from all the muskets, so
  as to prevent their returning the enemy's fire! And this by order of
  their General. Is not this a fresh invention? If so, it is a cruel
  one!</p>

  monster-tomb surrounded by a lofty iron railing," with the following
  inscription in letters of a large size:</p>

  <p>After stating that in the same tomb lie the bodies of the daughter of
  D'Aye, and his wife (ob. 1779), their grandson (1803), and great-grandson
  (1792), the writer adds that there is a <i>tradition</i> in Soham that,
  during the lifetime of Mrs. D'Aye, out of respect to the doings of Oliver
  Cromwell, on the anniversary of King Charles's martyrdom, <i>a calf's
  head besmeared with blood</i> was hoisted on a pole in front of the cot

  Eulenspiegel (or Howleglass, as Coplande renders it), of whose adventures
  "N. &amp; Q." has had several notices, is another example of upright
  burial, as the following passage, translated by Roscoe, shows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Howleglass was buried in the year 1350, and his latter end was almost
  as odd and as eccentric as his life. For, as they were lowering him again
  into the grave, one of the ropes supporting the feet gave way, and left
  the coffin in an upright position, so that Howleglass was still upon his
  legs. Those who were present then said: 'Come, let us leave him as he is,
  for as he was like nobody else when he was alive, he is resolved to be as
  queer now he is dead.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Accordingly, they left Howleglass bolt upright, as he had fallen; and
  placing a stone over his head, on which was cut the figure of an owl with
  a looking-glass under his claws, the device of his name, they inscribed
  round it the following lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We have been informed that Professor Ranke has found out a passage in
  Ammianus Marcellinus by which it is unquestionably proved that
  table-turning was known in the east of the Roman Empire.</p>

  <p>"The table-turners of those days were summoned as sorcerers before the
  Council, and the passage referred to appears to have been transcribed
  from the Protocol. The whole ceremony (<i>modus movendi hic fuit</i>) is
  very precisely described, and is similar to what we have so often
  witnessed within the last month; only that the table-turners, instead of
  sitting round the table, danced round it. The table-oracle likewise
  answered in verse, and showed a decided preference for hexameters. Being
  asked 'Who should be the next emperor?' the table answered 'Theod.' In
  consequence of this reply, the government caused a certain Theodorus to
  be put to death. Theodosius, however, became emperor.</p>

  <p>"The table oracle, in common with other oracles, had a dangerous
  equivocal tendency."</p>

  <p><i>Mackey's "Theory of the Earth"</i> (Vol. viii. pp. 468.

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Died, on Saturday se'night, at Doughty's Hospital in this city,
  Samson Arnold Mackey, aged seventy-eight years. The deceased was born at
  Haddiscoe, and was a natural son of Captain Samson Arnold of Lowestoft.
  He has been long known to many of the scientific persons of Norwich, and
  was remarkable for the originality of his views upon the very abstruse
  subject of mythological astronomy, in which he exhibited great sagacity,
  and maintained his opinions with extraordinary pertinacity. He received
  but a moderate education; was put apprentice to a shoemaker at the age of
  eleven, served his time, and for many years afterwards was in the
  militia. He did not again settle in Norwich until 1811, when he hired the
  attic storey of a small house in St. Paul's, where he followed his
  business and pursued his favourite studies. About 1822 he published his
  first part of <i>Mythological Astronomy</i>, and gave lectures to a
  select few upon the science in general. In 1825 he published his
  <i>Theory of the Earth</i>, and several pamphlets upon the antiquity of
  the Hindoos. His room, in which he worked, took his meals, slept, and
  gave his lectures, was a strange exhibition of leather, shoes, wax,
  victuals, sketches of sphinxes, zodiacs, planispheres; together with
  orreries of his own making, geological maps and drawings, illustrative of
  the Egyptian and Hindoo Mythologies. He traced all the geological changes
  to the different inclinations of the earth's axis to the plane of its
  orbit, and was fully persuaded that about 420,000 years ago, according to
  his theory, when the poles of the earth were last in that position, the
  geological phenomena now witnessed were produced. From his singular
  habits, he was of course looked upon with wonder by his poor neighbours,
  and those better informed were inclined to annoy him as to his religious
  opinions. He had a hard struggle of late years to obtain subsistence, and
  his kind friend and patron the late Mr. Moneyment procured for him the
  asylum in which he died. He held opinions widely different to most men;
  but it must not be forgotten that, humble as he was, his scientific
  acquirements gained him private interviews with the late Duke of Sussex,
  the Duke of Somerset, and many learned men in the metropolis."</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>If, as we believe, the first and greatest qualifications for an editor
  of Shakspeare be love for his author and a thorough appreciation of his
  beauties, Mr. Charles Knight may well come forward once more in that
  character. And, as he well observes, the fact of his having laboured for
  many years in producing a body of Commentary on Shakspeare, so that he
  was, out of the necessity of its plan, compelled not to miss any point,
  or slur over any difficulty, renders him not the less fitted for the
  preparation of an edition which is intended to be "The People's
  Shakspeare." The first volume of this edition, which he calls <i>The
  Stratford Shakspeare</i>, is now before us. It comprises the "Facts
  connected with the Life and Writings of Shakspeare," and the "Notice of
  Original Editions," and a most valuable shilling's worth it is. And there
  can be little doubt that, if Mr. Knight realises his intentions of
  suiting the present work to the wants of the many, by his endeavours,
  without any elaborate criticism, to unravel the difficulties of a plot,
  to penetrate the subtlety of a character, and to show the principle upon
  which the artist worked, the present will be the crowning labour of his
  many praiseworthy endeavours to place a good edition of the works of our
  great dramatist within the reach of all.</p>

  <p>We cannot better show the utility and interest of <i>The Autograph
  Miscellany; a Collection of Autograph Letters, Interesting Documents,
  &amp;c., selected from the British Museum, and other sources Public and
  Private</i>, than by stating the contents of the first number, which
  certainly contains admirable lithographic facsimiles of&mdash;I. Queen
  Elizabeth's Letter to the House of Commons in answer to their Petition
  respecting her Marriage; II. Letter from Catherine de Medici; III. Wren's
  Report on the Design for the Summit of the City Monument; IV. Letter from
  Rubens on the Defeat of the English at Rochelle. Their execution is
  certainly most creditable to the artist, Mr. F. Netherclift.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>The Works of Joseph
  Addison, with Notes by Dr. Richard Hurd, Bishop of Worcester, in Four
  Volumes, with Engravings, Vol. I.</i> This is the first of a new, cheap,
  and well-printed edition of Hurd's <i>Addison</i>, and forms one of Mr.
  Bohn's new series of <i>British Classics</i>.&mdash;<i>The Russians of
  the South</i>, by Shirley Brooks, the 53rd Part of Longman's
  <i>Traveller's Library</i>, is a very lively and amusing little volume.
  It would have been read with interest at any time, but is especially
  deserving of attention at the present moment.</p>
